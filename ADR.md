# Core Values

  - maximal similarity between live production and local dev environment (eg no special difference between complex hot module replacement with websockets and completely different live updating system)
  - completely type and schemaless prototyping with gradual optional migration to typing and schemas where it makes sense in production
  - minimal amount of code possible to achieve desired results without being "magic" in the rails sense
  - offline capable wherever possible / minimal latency
