# atreyu

## Getting started

#### 1. Install environment dependencies.

You need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=16). We recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.22.10).
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (1.14.2)
- [IPFS Cli](https://ipfs.io/). Installation instructions are [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/).

After following each installation steps, check if everything is working:

```bash
node --version
yarn --version
deno --version
ipfs --version
```

You should get the version of each tool printed without any errors.

#### 2. Configure [Deno scripts](https://deno.land/manual/tools/script_installer) to be available on your PATH.

You can achieve that by adding `export PATH="$HOME/.deno/bin:$PATH"` to your rc file.


## All following steps executed in root of repo folder:



#### 3. Install nodejs dependencies and build the nodejs dependency bundles for the project.

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

#### 4. Install `ayu` CLI.

This step installs the atreyu cli "ayu" on your system, which is  a standard [Deno script](https://deno.land/manual/tools/script_installer).
Deno is a proper sandbox unlike nodejs, so its best to always add permissions explicitly, however you can also omit most these settings and use --allow-all.
please keep in mind that the ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH (the one that includes esbuild-darwin-arm6) permission is currently hard coded, so you need to run this once with prompt and check your actual binary location and architecture.

Run:

```bash
deno install --allow-hrtime --allow-read --allow-env=DENO_DIR,HOME,ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH --allow-net=127.0.0.1:5001,api.cloudflare.com,api.pinata.cloud,registry.npmjs.org --allow-write="$TMPDIR","$HOME"/.atreyu,./,"$DENO_DIR" --allow-run=ipfs,npx,`which deno`,yarn --no-check --prompt --unstable -n ayu -f ./cli/mod.js


after initial exacution add the allow run path for the esbuild binary for example "$HOME"/Library/Caches/esbuild/bin/esbuild-darwin-arm64@0.13.3
```

Permission Prompts are not enabled automatically by `deno install` because of a current deno install bug, you need to add the `--prompt` parameter to beginning of the script manually...

eg. to edit the deno sccript in vscode:
```bash
code `which ayu`
```

add --promt:
```diff
#!/bin/sh
# generated by deno install
-exec deno run --allow-read <...lots of other things...>
+exec deno run --prompt --allow-read <...lots of other things...>
```

If everything is green, you should have `ayu` available on your terminal.

```bash
which ayu # prints the path for the binary
cat `which ayu` # is helpful to check the currently installed parameters
ayu info # prints the help text
```


#### 5. Initialize the atreyu repo including the ipfs repo and configuration setup in your home folder:

Initializes atreyu dev configuration and an IPFS repo for all assets at `~/.atreyu`.

```bash
ayu init
```


#### 6. Start atreyu local development build watcher and the dev daemon, that runs and serves the local dev setup.

```bash
ayu dev --start
```

shorthand for:
```
ayu start # in terminal 1
ayu dev # in terminal 2 in parallel
```



The dev daemon can be killed after the success message when not working on atreyu internals.
